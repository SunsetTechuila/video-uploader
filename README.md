## How to Set Up the Uploader

**These instructions assume that you have [forked](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository. Any specified action is done on your fork.**

After completing one or both of the given instructions you should be able to upload videos by [manually triggering](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) the *Upload Video* workflow.

### For Uploading to YouTube

1. [Generate a GitHub fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with **Write acess to your forked repository Secrets** and copy its value
2. [Create a secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) named *SECRETS_ACCESS_TOKEN* and and use the previously copied token as its value
3. [Create a variable](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository) named *UPLOAD_TO_YOUTUBE* with `true` value
    ___
    The following steps are only required for setting the uploader up, you will not need to perform them for further use.
