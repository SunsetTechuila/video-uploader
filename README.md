# Video Uploader

## How to Set Up the Uploader

**These instructions assume that you have [forked](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository. Any specified action is done on your fork.**

After completing one or both of the given instructions you should be able to upload videos by [manually triggering](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) the _Upload Video_ workflow.

### For Uploading to YouTube

1. [Generate a GitHub fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with **Write acess to your forked repository Secrets** and copy its value
2. [Create a secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) named _SECRETS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ and and use the previously copied token as its value
3. [Create a variable](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository) named _UPLOAD_TO_YOUTUBE_ with `true` value
4. [Manually trigger](<(https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow)>) the _Upload Video_ workflow

   > The following steps are only required for setting the uploader up, you will not need to perform them for further use.

5. Reload the page and then click the running workflow name
6. Click the _upload_ tile
7. Wait until you see the _go to google.com/device and enter the code_ message and then do what it says

### For Uploading to Telegram

1. [Obtain your Telegram app api_id and api_hash](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)
2. [Create secrets for your repository](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) with names _TELEGRAM_API_ID_, _TELEGRAM_API_HASH_ and corresponding values
3. Create a secret named _TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ with the target Telegram channel ID or username as its value
4. [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

7. Run `bun i`

   > Given account will be used to upload videos, so better to have the [Telegram Premium subscription](https://telegram.org/faq_premium) â€“ this will allow videos larger than 4 gigabytes to be uploaded without additional compression.

9. Create a secret named _TELEGRAM_SESSION_ and use the previously copied session as its value
10. [Create a variable](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository) named _UPLOAD_TO_TELEGRAM_ with `true` value
